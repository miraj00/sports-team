## SPORTS TEAM
Objectives: TypeScript interfaces and classes

# Setup & Submission: 
Create a new TypeScript project on Replit.com. Submit in the LMS by pasting a link to your Repl. 

# Build Specifications
First, in a Player.ts file, create and export an interface called Player that has the following properties:
name (string)
jersey (number)
active (boolean)

Next, in a Team.ts file, create and export  a class called Team with the following members:
Properties:
players (array of Player) - starts an an empty array
teamName (a string)
# Methods:
constructor: use a parameter to set the teamName
addPlayer method, which takes a Player object as a parameter and adds it to the list
removePlayer, which takes an index of a player and removes it from the list.
setActive, which takes an index of a player, and a boolean for active or inactive, and stores the boolean in that playerâ€™s active member.
getPlayerCount: Takes no parameters; returns the number of players.
logActivePlayers: Log to the console, one per line, a list of players whose active status is set to true
getActivePlayers: Returns a list of players whose active status is set to true

# Manually test your code by exercising each method in index.ts. Create one or more Team instances, add players, and call the various methods.

# Extended Challenges
Add additional methods to Team:
removePlayerByName: removes a player by name rather than index. You can loop through the array to find a match; or you can explore the findIndex function.
sortByName: Sort the players alphabetically by name. For some tips, see this stack overflow.
toString: return a string that includes the team name and a list of the active players.
